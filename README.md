This repo is a MySQL Instagram Dataset clone and includes some Challenges to play with the data.
I learned this at The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp at Udemy.
# Instructions:

File => Open SQL Script and open use.sql and execute it.<br/>
Now we are using instagram_clone_db schema.<br/>
File => Open SQL Script and open set_sql_mode.<br/>
Create these below queries with File => New Query Tab (or, use MySQL Workbench UI for the same)<br/>
SELECT * FROM users;<br/>

SELECT * FROM likes;<br/>
SELECT * FROM follows;<br/>
SELECT * FROM tags;<br/>
